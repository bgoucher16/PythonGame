# PythonGame

A very basic game made for one of my Computer Science Classes.

You go from room to room collecting each of the 6 items. There is 8 rooms and 6 of the rooms have an item. 1 Room has the dragon, if you get to that room before you get the items you can choose to fight, but you will lose. Another one of the rooms has nothing in it forcing you to go into every room to find all of the items in the game.
